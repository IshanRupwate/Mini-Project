# Mini Project
Using C++ I have created a small mini game "Casino Royale".

Rules of Casino Royale:
1.Bet an amount for a number between 1 to 10.
2.If he predicts the number right he gets tenfold of his betting amount.
3.If he loses he loses his money.

Working:

This uses rand() function to create a function from cstdlib preprocessor directory to generate an random variable between 1 to 10.
